## **Scripts for running obitools pipeline**

This repository contains scripts to run metabarcoding Illumina reads through a modified obitools pipeline.
**obi_cobble.job** contains the workflow to run Illumina data through a Slurm workload manager. I have made comments that allow you to work through the pipeline yourself. 

**submit_parallel_ngsfilter.sh** and **submit_parallel_ecotag.sh** allow the user to run the demultiplexing and taxonomic assignment using parallel processing respectively.
